# Pretty Things That Have No Purpose

I often get caught up worrying about whether I'm spending my time working on something that will ultimately serve a social good. Typically these thoughts end without resolution; I spend all of my time stressing and none of it working. That's why I'm making Pretty Things That Have No Purpose. This blog is a collection of things I think look nice and found meditative to work on.
